# kafka-related

This repo is just a weekend Kafka lesson. I'm spending some time learning how to use kafka in spring! Everything in this repo is just for learning purposes. 

Apache Kafka is simply a publish/subscribe messaging system. Data within Kafka is stored similar to how it would be in a database. 

Installing Kafka on macOS
- to download kafka instance: https://kafka.apache.org/quickstart
- tar -xzf kafka_2.13-2.8.0.tgz
- cd kafka_2.13-2.8.0
